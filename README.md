# üéì Student Management System

A beginner-friendly Java-based project that lets you manage student records via a console interface. It‚Äôs a great way to learn key concepts like JDBC, Maven, and basic console UI development.

> üí° *My first Java project started small and has grown steadily in features and robustness.*

---

## üöÄ Overview

- **Purpose:** Manage student records using a console-based application.
- **Core Features:**
    - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - **MySQL Database Integration:** Upgraded from file-based storage for better data management.
    - Input validation and error handling for a smoother user experience.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Java 21:** Check with:
    ```powershell
    java -version
    ```
- **Maven 3.9+:** Check with:
    ```powershell
    mvn -version
    ```
- **MySQL 9.2.0:** Ensure it‚Äôs installed and running.
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for seamless development.

## üîß Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/ShreyanGit-5/student-management-system.git
    ```

2. **Set Up MySQL:**
    - **Create a Database:**
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE student_db;
    ```

    - **Create a `students` Table:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE students (
        id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
        age INT NOT NULL,
        grade VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

3. **Import the Project:**
    - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or your favorite IDE).

4. **Configure the Database Connection:**
    - Update the `database.properties` file with your credentials:
    ```
    db.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student_db
    db.user = root
    db.password = your_password  # Replace with your actual password
    ```

5. **Run the Application:**
    - In IntelliJ, select `Run > Main.java` to start the console app.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Usage

### Basic Operations

- **Adding a Student:**
    - The system will prompt you for:

        ```
        Enter student name: John Doe
        Enter age: 20
        Enter grade: A
        
        ```

- **Displaying Students:**
    - See a list of students with details:

        ```
        ID: 1 | Name: John Doe | Age: 20 | Grade: A
        
        ```


### Advanced Features

- **Database Integration:**
    - Uses JDBC with `PreparedStatement` for secure SQL operations.
    - Upgraded from a file-based system to a robust MySQL database.
- **Input Validation & Error Handling:**
    - Checks for valid entries (e.g., proper age ranges, correct grade formats) and handles exceptions gracefully.
- **Reporting Tools:**
    - üìà **Grade Distribution Report:**  
      Visualizes student grade patterns and trends.

    - üë• **Age-Range Analysis:**
      <div align="center">
        <img src="assets/age_range_analysis.png" width="250">
      </div>  
      Displays the distribution of students across different age groups.

    - üî¢ **Summary Statistics:**  
      Provides aggregate data like average age, total students, etc.

    - üèÜ **Top Performers Overview:**
      <div align="center">

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

- **GUI Upgrade:**
    - Transition from a console-based UI to a modern GUI using JavaFX for a more intuitive experience.
- **User Authentication:**
    - Add role-based access (e.g., admin vs. student) for improved security.
- **Executable JAR Build:**
    - Package the application into an executable JAR file:
        - Compile the code.
        - Create a manifest file to specify the main class.
        - Bundle everything into one standalone package.
    - *Status:* Not yet implemented ‚Äì this remains in the future roadmap.
- **Testing Enhancements:**
    - Introduce comprehensive unit tests using **JUnit 5** to ensure the reliability of core functionalities.
